    <font size="5"><p><i> Feedback is about listening actively, taking the time to analyze, and then thinking of the best possible solution to perform better. It provides positive criticism and allows to see what everyone can change to improve their focus and results. It brings people together and creates a healthy communication flow.Openness to criticism and an urge to seek feedback are the other positive effects that save you big time. It’s not uncommon that the best ideas come from someone on the team who simply mentions a solution to a problem or points out an issue that others haven’t noticed yet. Effective feedback provides concrete information upon which students can act to alter their results. By contrast, vague or value-based statements such as “Well done” or “Incorrect” don’t help students understand why they did well or what they should do to improve.
        User-friendly. Feedback for learning should be carefully crafted. It should be delivered in a way that makes it easy to understand. To be effective, it needs to be accessible to the audience, be it an entire class or one student.
