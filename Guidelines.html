    <font size="4"><p>Food guides are graphic representations of all or some of the messages of the dietary guidelines. They typically represent the recommended food groups in the suggested proportions for a good diet. Messages about lifestyle, such as recommendations of regular physical activity and warnings related to alcohol consumption may also be displayed. The most common example of food guides are in the shape of a food pyramid and food plate. However, many countries choose a food guide that is culturally specific for the population of each country and may become an important symbol in a nation's nutrition communication and education strategy.</p></font><br>
    <font size="4"><p>The implementation of dietary guidelines should be monitored and evaluated regularly. It would be useful to develop implementation and evaluation mechanisms in parallel with the development of the guidelines themselves, in order to sensitize the nationâ€™s nutrition leaders and bring an action plan into play at the same time as the guidelines are promulgated.</p></font><br>

    <font size="4"><p>In the past decade, more and more countries have started to incorporate sustainability considerations into their food policies and consumer education programmes. Given the policy and programmatic implications of FBDGs, the development and integration of recommendations that promote specific food practices and choices have been an obvious strategy for addressing sustainability, mainly in its nutrition and environment dimensions.</p></font><br>
    <font size="4"><p>FAO has been working during the last two decades to support Member Countries in the development, implementation and revision of their guidelines. The current focus is on the one hand, to advocate for and assist countries in the development process within regions where FBDGs are still lacking; and on the other, to support the use of existing ones to effectively guide supply-side policies and measures, demand-side programmes and related training structures, in pursue of healthier diets.</p></font><br>
